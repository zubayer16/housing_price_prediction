# housing_price_prediction
A housing price predictor have been built in this project. The dataset was pre-processed and splitted into training and testing sets. Linear regression and pipeline has been used to make prediction where I achieved 66% accuracy using regression and 74% accuracy using Pipeline. Lastly I tried to illustrate the difference between the actual and predicted values.
